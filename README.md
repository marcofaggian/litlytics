## Running as a Docker container

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Then, start LitLytics from [image](https://github.com/yamalight/litlytics/pkgs/container/litlytics) by running following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/yamalight/litlytics:latest
```

This will launch the platform inside a docker container, and you will be able to interact with it in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running locally in development mode

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (>=1.1.0) installed.

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yamalight/litlytics.git
cd litlytics
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

And finally start the LitLytics platform:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will launch the platform, and you will be able to interact with it in your browser: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Running pipelines via API

`POST /api/execute` endpoint executes pipeline using given LLM provider and model.  
The body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

- **modelConfig** (`ModelConfig`): Configuration of the model you wish to use, as follows:
  - **provider**: The language model provider you wish to use.
  - **model** (`LLMModel`): The specific model to use, based on the selected provider.
  - **key** (`string`): The API key to authenticate with the specified provider.
- **pipeline** (`Pipeline`): The configuration for the processing pipeline.

Example request:

```json
{
  "modelConfig": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "key": "sk-your-api-key"
  },
  "pipeline": {
    // your pipeline configuration
  }
}
```

A response will include new pipeline config that includes results of the task execution.
